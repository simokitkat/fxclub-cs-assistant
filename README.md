## Simplifying Customer Support for FXclub Agents

As a customer support agent, I created the FXclub CS Assistant to simplify my own workflow and help my colleagues deliver exceptional service with ease. My goal is to provide a set of efficient tools that minimize manual effort and maximize the quality of support we provide to our customers.

## Overview

### Features

Users should be able to:

- **Link Decoder**: A handy tool that decodes encoded links, removing unnecessary characters like %, ?, and more.
- **AI Assistant**: An AI-powered tool that helps agents write emails to customers in multiple languages, simplifying the process and reducing response times.

### Notes

- The website isn't responsive. The reason for that is that we work on laptops only so I didn't find a reason to make it responsive on mobile and other devices.
- The backend is hosted on a free render.com server which means that if you leave the chat for a while and then try to type a prompt, it may take about 30 seconds to respond, but after that it will be responding faster if you keep on using it actively during the day.
